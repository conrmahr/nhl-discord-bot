# Contributing

We would love for you to contribute to nhl-discord-bot and help make it even better than it is
today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#coc)
 - [Question or Problem?](#question)
 - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)

## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct

Help us keep the project open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

## <a name="question"></a> Got a Question or Problem?

Do not open issues for general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests.

If you would like to chat about the question in real-time, you can reach out via [our discord server][discord].

## <a name="issue"></a> Found a Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github] following our [issue template][issue-template]. Even better, you can submit a [Pull Request][pr-template] with a fix.

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature?

You can *request* a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.
